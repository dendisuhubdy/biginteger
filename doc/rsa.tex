\section{The RSA algorithm}
The RSA algorithm is the most widely-used public-key encryption algorithm.
It is invented in 1977 by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman.

\subsection{\texttt{void keygen(bignum *n, bignum *e, bignum *d, int length)}}
This algorithm does following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item generate two large primes $p$ and $q$ with same length, and $p \neq q$
  \item compute $n = p*q$ and $\phi = (p-1)(q-1)$ 
  \item select a random integer $e$, $1 < e < \phi$ such that $\texttt{gcd}(e,
    \phi) = 1$
  \item compute a $d$ such that $e \dot d \equiv 1\ \texttt{mod}\ \phi$ using
    the extended Euclidean algorithm
\end{enumerate}
The public key $(n, e)$. The private key is $d$.

\subsection{\texttt{void RSAencrypt(bignum m, bignum e, bignum n)}}
Given a message $m < N$, then ciphertext is computed as
$$c = m^e\ \texttt{mod}\ n$$ with public key $(n, e)$.

\subsection{\texttt{void RSAdecrypt(bignum c, bignum d, bignum n)}}
Given a ciphertext $e$, to recover $m$, compute
$$m = c^d \ \texttt{mod}\ n$$ with private key $d$.
