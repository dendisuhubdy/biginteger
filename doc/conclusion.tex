\section{Conclusion}
We provide an efficient and secure implementation of simplified SWU Algorithm in 
this report.  The efficiency of our implementation is mainly thanks to the classic
double and add approach to compute the multiple of point on elliptic curve
and the time saving in the selection part of the algorithm. Specifically,
out technique saves half of exponential computation time,
compared with the original implementation.
