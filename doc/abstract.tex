\begin{abstract}
We provide an efficient implementation of simplified Shallue-Woestijne-Ulas
(SWU) algorithm, which is a hash function into elliptic curves from CRYPTO 2009.
Furthermore, we implement group operations on elliptic curves with certain
parameters, and
a key exchange scheme based on elliptic curves - Simple Password Exponential
Key Exchange (SPEKE) with simplified-SWU algorithm as the hash function mapping
from string into point on elliptic curves.
The efficiency of our implementation mainly relies on the classic double and
add approach to compute the multiple of point on elliptic curve and the
reduction of exponential computation in the selection part of the SWU algorithm.
